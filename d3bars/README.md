# An example of a 3D bar chart using D3 and Aframe.

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png "An example of a 3D bar chart using D3 and Aframe.")

This is a demo of [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/) together to render a 3D block shape. This is the beginning of an example of how you could use Aframe and D3 to make a 3D bar chart.

# Install

Use `npm install` or `yarn add` which will install all dependencies and automatically run `browserify main.js > main.combined.js` to build the project.

# Run

Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or your preferred static file host to serve the files. Then navigate to `http://localhost:4000` (or wherever you have your files hosted). If you try to load index.html directly, you will likely see an error.
